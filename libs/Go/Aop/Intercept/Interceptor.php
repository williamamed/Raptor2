 * This interface represents a generic interceptor.

 * in) joinpoints. Runtime joinpoints can be invocations, field
 * access, exceptions...
 *
 * This interface is not used directly. Use the the sub-interfaces
 * to intercept specific events. For instance, the following class
 * implements some specific interceptors in order to implement a
 * debugger:
 *
 * <pre class=code>
 * class DebuggingInterceptor implements Interceptor {
 *
 *   public function invoke(Joinpoint $i) {
 *       $this->debug($i->getStaticPart(), $i->getThis(), $i->getArgs());
 *       return $i->proceed();
 *   }
 *
 *   protected function debug($accessibleObject, $object, $value) {
 *       ...
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
