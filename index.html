<p>Starting with the first change in Raptor is the removal of the old core
and the use of Slim microframework in it's place. After a lot of testing
we fall in love of Slim to take the place of the core, with very documentation
and periodical updates.</p>

<p>In the beginning we decide base the arquitecture of raptor in the Symfony
proposal, reducing the congnitive charge with people that see this filosofy.</p>

<p>What change? Thanks to the feedbak of all kind of developer, we figure out
that exist many factors inside of this arquitecture in particular the
configurations methods that complicate or destroy our main gold of reducing
the conginitive charge. In Raptor 2 we remove the unnecesary configurations
files, routes chains through configuration and in general all the things
that can be a sustancial charge to the developer.</p>

<p>In real terms all the routes declarations is delegated in the definitions
to the controllers through annotations. Besides of grouping in it's real
place we remove all the execive configurations in the system, making easy
the task of developing. The configuration location or app is delegated
to the real resposability meaning that is for global configurations only,
never interfering with the bundle logic.</p>

</h2>

<p>The Security Module(Syntarsus) continue with the access control model based on structures.
To be more faster and integrate the flow we unified the concept of routes, placing the old action manager in the privileges manager, with a few of cool functions like detecting automatictly the actions, and add it to his corresponding privilege, your work this time will be edit it if you want. Great !!
With the inclusion of Interactive module we give you a complete Guide of the module to understand his work and help you with the terms more complex in the security and Syntarsus.

<h2>
<a id="interactive-guide" class="anchor" href="#interactive-guide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interactive Guide</h2>

<p>This is one of the best funtions in Raptor 2, the module erase the old idea of users manual. The interactive functions will give you the necesary tools to show tutorials in real time and interact with the user.
The module is installed by default under the vendor Raptor2 in the src location, to use it only you need is create the necesary templates about your content and call it in real time in the interface based on events of user interaction.</p>

<h2>
<a id="clients-libreries" class="anchor" href="#clients-libreries" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clients libreries</h2>

<p>One of our gold is provide a full integration with the client side libreries
providing security mechanism to protect the comunications beetwen layers.
Raptor include Extjs, jQuery and Angular with no need of intalled, you can
create fully configuraded templates in every tecnology and just used with
no especial action needed. The Ui generator guarantee that creation in the
correct way.
The system give you access to functions in the front-end thanks to the 
javascript core always accesible through the Raptor object.</p>

<h2>
<a id="new-functions-and-bundles" class="anchor" href="#new-functions-and-bundles" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New functions and bundles</h2>

<p>The new characteristics include the view plugins mechanisms, inyecting
code in our definitions or in the defined by Raptor. We can do a lot of
things with this, create new javascript functions inyecting them to the
javascript core Raptor, inyect new functions to the Raptor panel etc.</p>

<p>The new instalation component guarantee in a visual way the installation
and the importing of bundles from a local repository(in short time can be
remote). To give support to this system we implanted the installation 
manifiest concept. This concept determine the bundle state and instalations 
directives to the Raptor bundle. In this way the system implement
the automatic detection and installation of compoments, besides the removal
of ghost bundles.</p>

<a id="installation-proccess" class="anchor" href="#installation-proccess" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation proccess</h2>

<p>It's real easy to run and install, download the source, uncompress in your
web server and give permissions if you are in a UNIX enviroment.</p>

<p>After that you are ready to run Raptor in you localhost machine like this:
    http://localhost/Raptor2/web/dev.php</p>

<p>You must run it through the dev front in order to get the development enviroment</p>

<p>Enjoy your Raptor !! Is easy to use, faster to run and great to build apps</p>
