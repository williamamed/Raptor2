===========================================

Coding standard
---------------
PSR-0, PSR-1 and PSR-2.
Test with the PHPCS configuration in tools/phpcs/ruleset.xml
(note if you have PHPStorm you can use this to turn on the PHPCS inspection).


Testing
-------
Use PHPUnit for Unit Testing.
Test with the 2 known users: (SimpleSAMLphp)[http://www.simplesaml.org] and
